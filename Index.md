# NOTE #

**Note: most documentation in the wiki is now deprecated in favor of [the installation documentation](http://www.genesis-sim.org/userdocs/developer-installation/developer-installation.html) available from [the Genesis 3 documentation system](http://www.genesis-sim.org/userdocs/documentation-homepage/documentation-homepage.html).**

The wiki pages in active development can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/neurospaces/w/list).

# Introduction #

The neurospaces wiki is used by people who are involved in development of the [Neurospaces](http://www.neurospaces.org/) based implementation of the Genesis 3 simulator.

In principle anyone can join, yet we do focus on tools and documentation related to the software development.  So this is not a wiki for users who want to do scientific simulations.
