G3 doc: workflow-documentation

# Introduction #

This page explains the workflow used by developers for writing documentation that propagates to the GENESIS documentation website.

Developers use the google neurospaces site to write documentation.  The documentation supervisor (Allan) then picks up the wiki pages and, after polishing, inserts them in the GENESIS 3 documentation project and deprecates them on the wiki.  Then, the converted pages are translated to html on the GENESIS website.  Not all the converted pages need to be fully finished.  Changes to the documentation (but not the wiki) automatically propagate to the GENESIS website.
