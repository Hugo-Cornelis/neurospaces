G3 Doc: userdocs-cron

= Introduction =

The GENESIS documentation system is very time consuming so it is desirable to set up the documentation build as an unmanned operation. The userdocs package comes with a cron script that can be set up to run at periodic intervals to keep your documentation up to date.

== Configuration ==

To configure the userdocs_cron script you must construct a YAML file with the following options:

  * MAILTO - _An email recipient to send an email to on completion of the job_
  * MAILFROM - _A desired email address to send a completion email from._
  * HTMLDIR - A directory which will hold your userdocs html data directory to be served form the internet. 
  * OUTPUTDIR - _A directory to write the output log data._
  * URL - _An http link which serves the test harness output._

Example configuration file`:`
{{{
---
MAILTO: my@email.com
MAILFROM: userdocs@buildmachine.com
HTMLDIR: 
OUTPUTDIR: /tmp
URL: http://mywebsite/userdocs
}}}
