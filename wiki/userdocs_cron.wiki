= Introduction =

The GENESIS documentation system is very time consuming

== Configuration ==

To configure the userdocs_cron script you must construct a YAML file with the following options:

  * MAILTO - _An email recipient to send an email to on completion of the job_
  * MAILFROM - _A desired email address to send a completion email from._
  * HTMLDIR - A directory which will hold your userdocs html data directory to be served form the internet. 
  * OUTPUTDIR - _A directory to write the output log data._
  * URL - _An http link which serves the test harness output._
