#summary (In Progress) Creating a test for Heccer
#labels G3Doc

= Introduction =

This is a guide for creating a test for the Heccer package. Since Heccer and it's associated simulation objects are all compiled into a library, programs are written in C and compiled against this library to test each use case. In this example we will create suitable tests for our PulseGen simulation object (simobj_PulseGen) that we created before[Creating_a_new_simulation_object].

= Source Files =

The source files for the Heccer tests are found in the _tests/code_ directory within the Heccer Package. 

= Adding our object to the test framework =

Since we are testing a new simulation object, we need to make the test framework aware of our object. First we must add a line to the files:

{{{
tests/code/main.c
tests/code/main.h
}}}

In _tests/code/main.c_ we add:

{{{
struct simobj_PulseGen *ppg = NULL;
}}}

Then in _tests/code/main.h_ we add:

{{{
extern struct simobj_PulseGen *ppg;
}}}

Now the main driver for the test framework is aware of our PulseGen simulation object. Next we create a source file that demonstrates a specific use case.

= Use Case =

Ideally you want to test your output against a use case which can be verified to work. Since the PulseGen object is a port of the same object used in GENESIS 2, we can obtain output from a GENESIS 2 script to compare to the output of our simulation object.
