#summary Creating a test for Heccer

= Introduction =

This is a guide for creating a test for the Heccer package. Since Heccer and it's associated simulation objects are all compiled into a library, programs are written in C and compiled against this library to test each use case. In this example we will create suitable tests for our PulseGen simulation object (simobj_PulseGen) that we created before [Creating_a_new_simulation_object].

= Source Files =

The source files for the Heccer tests are found in the _tests/code_ directory within the Heccer Package.
