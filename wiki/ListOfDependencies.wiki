Dependencies fall into two categories:

1. Binary dependencies.
2. Perl dependencies.


= Details =

Binary dependencies:

  * a compiler, and a makefile system.  See the GNU website.  Most Linux distributions come with these installed.
  * GTK+, available for all common Linux distributions.
  * SDL2 for visualization functions.  For most systems there are prebuilt packages available.  Note that SDL2 is required, SDL1 does not suffice.
  * Graphviz, available from www.graphviz.org.  For redhat users: if you install this from an RPM, be sure to know what you are doing.

Perl dependencies:

All the following dependencies are available from CPAN (search.cpan.org).  You can install them with a command line like "sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Mail::Sender'", where "Mail::Sender" should be replaced with the appropriate package name.

    * Mail::Sender
    * Clone
    * Expect::Simple
    * YAML
    * File::Find::Rule
    * Digest::SHA
    * Data::Utilities
