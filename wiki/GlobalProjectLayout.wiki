= Developing Sources =

This page describes the directory structure I use to do Neurospaces development.  Also the general workflows should be described here.

[http://www.neurospaces.org/ The Neurospaces project] develops several software components useful for simulations using models based on experimental data:

  1 Each software component can have implementations in several programming languages (e.g. there is a java based and C based implementation of the [http://www.neurospaces.org/#section-neurospaces model-container component]).
  1 Each software component has several resources: source code, documentation, additional tools etc.
  1 Each software component can have experimental features, not part of an official distribution.  We call this a branch of the source code (it is irrelevant if such a branch is present in a version control system or not).

Conclusions:

  * the source code of a software component is normally put in a directory `$HOME/neurospaces_project/<package-name>/source/<programming language>/<branch name>/`.
  * Other resources are put in other directories: e.g. docs not part of the distribution can be put under `$HOME/neurospaces_project/<package-name>/docs/`.

The InstallerPackage has builtin support for this directory structure when working in developer mode (using its `--developer` option).

= Configuration =

Configuration comes in the `/etc/neurospaces/` directory.
