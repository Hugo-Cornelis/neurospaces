#summary How to make a release ?

= Introduction =

The same procedure is used to building a release of all or individual packages.  An official release will be made available for download on sourceforge.  Intermediate releases are for internal use only.

The release procedure normally checks for package correctness using the automake 'distcheck' target.  Official releases must always succeed on this target.  Intermediate releases might fail on this target.

  * Set the tag(s).
    * In principal developer tags follow the naming convention '<milestone-number>.  So for example for the latest release at this moment, the release tag is 'des-10', which is the tenth subrelease of the 'des' milestone.
    * Milestone labels point to an important event for development.
    * Tag numbers are monotonically increasing.
    * Some packages might skip some releases -- milestone labels as well as release numbers.
    * Internally, the development system refers to the milestone labels as 'major', the numbers as 'minor', and for future use, there is also a 'micro' number possible.
  * More will follow.
