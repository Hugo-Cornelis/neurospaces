Building wxPython from source:

To use wxPython you must first build wxWidgets, which is included with the wxPython source tarball. To build wxWidgets you'll need these libraries installed. To compile you'll need g++. 

  * zlib-dev
  * libjpeg-dev
  * libpng-dev
  * libtiff-dev
  * libgtk-dev


  If you want 3D bindings you'll need:
  * libglut-dev 

After building wxWidgets go into the wxPython directory and use the puthon script setup.py to build and install the wxPython bindings.
