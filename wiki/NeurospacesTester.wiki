The neurospaces tester framework provides a general purpose framework for regressing testing.

It allows to:

  * Test command line options.
  * Test communicate over file descriptors with an application, and test the behaviour of the application.
  * Test the consistency of the source code.
  * Has built in support for application specific libraries.
  * Allows to interact with the environment, including environment variables.
  * Allows to run the application in a chrooted environment.
  * Converts the test cases to html.

Despite the wealth of functionality, using and configuring the tester is quite simple, read below for more.  The latest version of the tester framework can be found in the model container package at the neurospaces website (http://www.neurospaces/org/).
