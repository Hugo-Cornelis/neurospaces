#summary An overview on the neurospaces_cron script.

= Introduction =

The neurospaces_cron script is part of the [InstallerPackage], its function is to perform sanity checks for communicating with a [NeurospacesRepository], system installation, and running tests to see that the software packages are properly working. This page is here to serve as a guide to show how to use the script, set up a cronjob and how to avoid some common pitfalls.



= Cron Job =

Typically started with a line in /etc/crontab like this:

01 00 `*` `*` `*` g3tester neurospaces_cron

g3tester is a  user set up for permissions to perform a 'sudo make install,' and 'sudo make uninstall' to run the job at 1 minute after midnight. To set up a regular user to use sudo, add them to the /etc/sudoers file.
