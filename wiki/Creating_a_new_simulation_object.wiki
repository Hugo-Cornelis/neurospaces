#summary (IN PROGRESS) Guide to creating a new solver object for GENESIS 3.

= Introduction =

This is a guide for adding a new simulation object to the Heccer package and integrating it with GENESIS 3.  


= Creating source files =

First we create the following source files for our object in the correct places in the Heccer package:

{{{
     pulsegen.c
     heccer/pulsegen.h
}}}


= Implementation =

<working on this>


= Compiling  =

To compile your simulation object into the heccer package
you must add your source files to some targets in the Makefile.am
of the heccer package.

In *libheccer_a_SOURCES* add:

{{{
	pulsegen.c
}}}


In *nobase_include_HEADERS* add:

{{{
	heccer/pulsegen.h 
}}}
