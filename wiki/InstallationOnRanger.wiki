= Introduction =

Ranger (ranger.tacc.utexas.edu) of TACC is currently the fourth fastest computer in the world.  It does not have all the perl modules necessary to compile and test Neurospaces.


= Details =

Make sure perl can find the modules you are going to install in your home directory.

{{{
mkdir -p ~/lib/perl5
echo '
export PERL5LIB=${PERL5LIB}:~/perl5lib' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
}}}

Empty the CPAN config such that you can install perl modules in your home directory.

{{{
mkdir -p ~/.cpan/CPAN
echo "\$CPAN::Config = {}"> ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm
perl -MCPAN -e shell
}}}
