#summary How to run the tester.

= Introduction =

The most convenient way to call the tester is by doing `make check`.  For Neurospaces software packages, this calls the command line `tests/neurospaces_harness`.

`tests/neurospaces_harness` is a perl script that runs all the TesterSpecifications found in `tests/specifications`.  A test specification is a file ending in the suffix `.t`.


  * `neurospaces_harness` runs all the test specifications found in the `specifications` directory.  A test specification ends in the suffix `.t`.

  * `--regex` option runs those test specifications that match with the given regular expression.  E.g. `neurospaces_harness --regex convertors` runs all tests whose pathnames match with `convertors`.

  * `--numerical-compare` enables numerical comparisons for numerical output.

  * `--randomize-order` randomizes the order of the tests before executing them.

  * `--timeout-multiplier` multiplies all timeout values with the given constant.

  * `--timings` adds timing information to the test report.
