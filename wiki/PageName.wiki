#summary Wiki for Neurospaces project developers.

= Introduction =

The neurospaces wiki is used by people who are involved in development of the Neurospaces based implementation of the Genesis 3 simulator.

In principle anyone can join, yet we do focus on tools and documentation related to the software development.  So this is not a wiki for users who want to do scientific simulations.
