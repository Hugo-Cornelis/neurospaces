#summary Creating Documentation for Level 3-7

= HTTP redirect =

At times it is necessary to direct users to documentation that is off site since reproducing the content can be time consuming, or require special host configurations (e.g youtube videos). By using the 'redirect' attribute in your documentation descriptor file, you can link to URLs on the internet, effectively integrating the linked content into your own documentation. 

An example of the use of the redirect tag can be shown here:

{{{
---
description: A redirect to a website
document name: Off Site Information
redirect: http://www.directmehere.edu
tags:
  - contents-level5
  - published
}}}


The structure is identical to previous descriptor files with the exception of our _redirect_ attribute. This will place a link to the content in the Level 5 contents page.
