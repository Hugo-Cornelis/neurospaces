#summary (IN PROGRESS) This guide outlines installing GENESIS on Debian 5.0.3

= Introduction =

This is a guide for setting up GENESIS 3 on a new Debain 5.0.3 installation, with the tester, code repository and webserver running.


= Setting up the Web Server =

Test run output as well as generated html files from programs like Xrefactory and Doxygen need to be accessible over the internet. This is a guide on adding the apache2 rules to set up a directory that will have its contents displayed via the http server.

== Configuration File /etc/apache2/apache2.conf ==

The default http configuration file for the Apache Web Server in Debian is in the file _/etc/apache2/apache2.conf_. The cleanest method for doing this is to put all of your rules in a separate file, then add an *Include* statement to the default configuration file to include your file. As in this example:

{{{
Include /etc/apache2/my.conf
}}} 


To start your configuration file you'll need a VirtualHost block. So the initial conf file should look like this.

{{{
NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>

</VirtualHost>
}}}


In your configuration file you will explicitly declare which directories you want served within the VirtualHost block. If you want to serve the directory _/var/www/tests_ for test output you simply declare a block in the your configuration file for the directory and an Alias directive so that the directory can be accesible via a suffix to the URL (such as http://myserver.edu/tests). Your configuration file should end up looking like this:

{{{
NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>

   <Directory /var/www/tests>
     Options +FollowSymLinks Indexes MultiViews
     AllowOverride All
     order allow,deny
     allow from all
   </Directory>

   Alias /tests /var/www/tests/

</VirtualHost>
}}}

For each directory you'd like to serve you must add a block and an alias 
After you updated your configuration restart apache with this command:

*apache2ctl restart*

You should now be able to view the contents of the directory /var/www/tests from your URL suffixed with your alias.
