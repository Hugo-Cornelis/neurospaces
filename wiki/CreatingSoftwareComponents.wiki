#summary How to create new neurospaces software components

= Introduction =

Neurospaces contains many software components.  The source code of the most important ones is publicly available from a central repository (virtual2 at cbi is coded as the default server in the InstallerPackage).  Other software components can be made available from other sources.  The installer package, when configured correctly, will automatically incorporate software components from distributed sources.

New software components can be added to the configuration of the neurospaces_build script of the InstallerPackage.
