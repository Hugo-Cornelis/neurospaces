#summary How to create new neurospaces software components

= Introduction =

Neurospaces contains many software components.  The source code of the most important ones is publicly available from a central repository (virtual2 at cbi is coded as the default server in the InstallerPackage).  Other software components can be made available from other sources.  The installer package, when configured correctly, will automatically incorporate software components from distributed sources.

New software components can be added to the configuration of the neurospaces_build script of the InstallerPackage.  All the other tools of the InstallerPackage, such as tools to compile and install, tools to synchronize the source code with remote servers, and tools to generate and publish documentation on a website will work with the new configuration.

= Creating a new software component, originator =

  * add the new software component to the configuration of the neurospaces_build script.  For example, for the model-container, you have
{{{
       'model-container' => {
			     './configure' => [
					       '--with-delete-operation',
					      ],
			     directory => "$ENV{HOME}/neurospaces_project/model-container/source/snapshots/0",
			     disabled => 0,
			     order => 1,
			     target_name => 'model-container',
			     version_control => {
						 port_number => 4693,
						 repository => "$ENV{HOME}/neurospaces_project/MTN/model-container.mtn",
						},
			    },
}}}
which includes the directory name where sources are to be found, the build order, and version control information (note that the server port number cannot be changed at anytime).
  * neurospaces_build --enable model-container --regex model-container --create-directories --developer
  * neurospaces_build --enable model-container --regex model-container --developer --repo-co

= Creating a new software component, other machines =

  * Get a version of the installer package that has configuration of the new software component.
  * `neurospaces_pull --enable docs --regex docs`
  *
