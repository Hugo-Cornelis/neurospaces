#summary Wiki for Neurospaces project developers.
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

Note: most documentation in the wiki is now deprecated in favor of [http://www.genesis-sim.org/userdocs/installation-introduction/installation-introduction.html the installation documents] of [http://www.genesis-sim.org/userdocs/documentation-overview/documentation-overview.html the official Genesis 3 documentation system].

The neurospaces wiki is used by people who are involved in development of the [http://www.neurospaces.org/ Neurospaces] based implementation of the Genesis 3 simulator.

In principle anyone can join, yet we do focus on tools and documentation related to the software development.  So this is not a wiki for users who want to do scientific simulations.
