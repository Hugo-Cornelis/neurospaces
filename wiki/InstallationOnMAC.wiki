= Introduction =

We are currently working on installation on the MAC.

= Note Book =

  * install monotone
  * install CPAN YAML
  * install make (no need to search for you CD if you have the matlab gmake, just make a symbolic link that is accessible from your $PATH)
  * download the installer from sourceforge
  * ./configure, make and sudo make install on the installer from sourceforge, or ...
  * ... cp -p neurospaces_build /usr/local/bin
  * neurospaces_build --help should work now
  * add /usr/local/bin to your $PATH
  * add /System/Library/Frameworks to your $PATH (why again ?)
  * use neurospaces_build to pull the latest installer
{{{
neurospaces_build --repo-pull virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu --repo-co --verbose --developer --directories-create --regex installer --enable installer
}}}
  * untar, configure, make and sudo make for the downloaded installer
  * neurospaces_pull (pulls all the enabled software components from the central repositories)
