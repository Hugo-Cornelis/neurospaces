= Introduction =

This page explains how to do a developer installation of GENESIS on a MAC.  Almost the same installation procedure for Neurospaces on a regular PC works on the MAC.


== Installing Dependencies ==

Note that some installation must be done from the terminal. The terminal can be found in the Applications/Utilities folder. Would be a good idea to drag the terminal to the doc for easy access.

  * Install monotone, this is freely available as a package from the monotone website http://monotone.ca/.
  * Install Xcode, the Apple Development Toolset. It is available disk 2 of Mac OSX under optional install. It is also available from the Apple Developer Website here http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html you will need a valid Apple ID to log in and access the developer page. _Note: It is not advised to use the compilers available from macports._
  * Install the following perl dependencies via CPAN:
    # YAML
    # Inline
    # RecDescent
    # Expect (and its dependency perl-IO)
    # ExtUtils
    # Data::Comparator


Once all of these prerequisites are met you can follow the standard developer installation outlined here:
