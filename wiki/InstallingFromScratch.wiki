#summary Installation of neurospaces packages from scratch

= Introduction =

Installation of neurospaces packages from scratch.

Because Neurospaces is compliant with the CBI simulator architecture, it consists of many independent software packages.  Because installation of the simulator, requires installation of many packages, an installer has been written.  The installer is part of the developer package.

Obviously you need to install Linux first (ListOfTestedDistributions).

Then you need to install the dependencies (ListOfDependencies).

Then follow this outline:

= Details =

(This is based on developer-build-13.tar.gz).

  * Install the neurospaces installer.
    * mkdir tmp ; cd tmp
    * mv <path to your developer package> tmp/developer-build-13.tar.gz
    * tar xfz developer-build-13.tar.gz
    * cd developer-build-13
    * ./configure
    * make
    * make check (some tests are known to fail at this moment, e.g. the test that downloads from a non-existent server fails, that is ok).
    * sudo make install
  Now the neurospaces installer has been installed.
  * Make a directory to contain downloaded packages.
    * mkdir $HOME/automated
  * Download and install the other packages
  This is done automatically by the neurospaces installer.  Use the following command line:
    * neurospaces_build --download-server downloads.sourceforge.net --src-tag des-10 --src-dir $HOME/automated
  Go for a coffee, and come back in an hour -- all the packages get tested, which takes some time.

  If you want to see what is going to happen, without making it happen, use the --check option:
    * neurospaces_build --download-server downloads.sourceforge.net --src-tag des-10 --src-dir $HOME/automated --check

  To select individual packages, use the --regex option, e.g. to install only heccer:
    * neurospaces_build --download-server downloads.sourceforge.net --regex heccer --src-tag des-10 --src-dir $HOME/automated

  If you don't trust what is going to happen, first use the --dry-run option and pipe to less (or more):
    * neurospaces_build --download-server downloads.sourceforge.net --src-tag des-10 --src-dir $HOME/automated --dry-run | less
