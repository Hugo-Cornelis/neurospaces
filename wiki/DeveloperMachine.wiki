[NeurospacesRepository]

= Introduction =

  * Use the InstallerPackage to do the initial directory layout.
  * The tools I use are gdb, gcc, xemacs with its many elisp packages.
  * The neurospaces NDF file format has a special elisp package for use with (x)emacs.
  * For version control I use Monotone (http://www.monotone.ca/), monotone is also supported by the InstallerPackage.
  * The monotone I use is statically linked.  Because Monotone is a distributed version control system, we sometimes send repositories and monotone executables as email attachments between developers.

= Directories =

  * there is a directory `~/neurospaces_project` in your home directory.
  * the directory `~/neurospaces_project/MTN` contains all monotone repositories accessible to the InstallerPackage.
  * every software package has its own subdirectory, eg. `~/neurospaces_project/heccer`
  * every software package has several subdirectories:
    * `docs` contains documentation not included in the distribution
    * `source/snapshots/0` contains the source code you are working on.
    * `source/snapshots/0/_MTN` is the directory with the monotone options specific to the source code.
    * `source/snapshots/0/installed` optionally contains a locally installed version of the software package.
    * `source/snapshots/patches` contains diffs / patches to your code.
