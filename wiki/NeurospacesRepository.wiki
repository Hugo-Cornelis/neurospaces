#summary Using the repository for development

= Introduction =

For coordinated development of all components of the neurospaces project the build machine should also house a monotone server that is connectible over the internet. This way changes made can be properly merged using the functions available on monotone. As a result the build mechanism will always build the most up to date version of the code.


= Details =

*Server*

A monotone server for the neurospaces project will be hosted at:

   _virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu_

_server details_

The build machine is already remotely connectible a virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu. So a bind using monotone can be performed using the command: 


   _mtn --db=server.mtn --bind=virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu serve_

A solution must be made so that the separate repositories can all be accessible via the single url. 



*Branches*

Since you must know the desired branch you want when pulling from a repository here available branches.

  _*Neurospaces Genesis SLI* - ns-genesis.sli_



*Pulling from the repository*

To pull a complete copy of a repository branch first initialize your own monotone repository:

   _mtn --db=myrepo.mtn db init_

Then execute a pull into your repository via.

   _mtn --db=myrepo.mtn pull virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu '<branch>'
