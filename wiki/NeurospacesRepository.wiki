= Introduction =

For coordinated development of all components of the neurospaces project the build machine houses a monotone server that is connectible over the internet. This way changes made can be properly merged using the functions available on monotone. As a result the build mechanism will always build the most up to date version of the code.

*Checking out code*

To check out the latest version of the neurospaces project code you must first initialize a local monotone repository via this command.

  _mtn --db=myrepo.mtn db init_

Then you may pull the code from the monotone server into your working repository via the command.

  _mtn --db=myrepo.mtn pull virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu "*"_

The "" argument pulls all branches from the server into your local repository. To pull a specific branch look at the next section. Once the code has been pulled you can checkout one of the branches into your working directory via the command:

  _mtn --db=myrepo.mtn --branch=<Branch ID> co source_directory_



*Branches*

Since you must know the desired branch you want when pulling a specific branch, here are the branches available on the monotone server.

  _*Neurospaces Genesis SLI* - ns-genesis.sli_

If you download all branches via the "&#42;" argument you can get a list of what branches are available to check out from your local repository via the command:

  _mtn --db=myrepo.mtn list branches
