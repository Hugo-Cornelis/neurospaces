#summary Using the repository for development

= Introduction =

For coordinated development of all components of the neurospaces project the build machine should also house a monotone server that is connectible over the internet. This way changes made can be properly merged using the functions available on monotone. As a result the build mechanism will always build the most up to date version of the code.


= Details =

The build machine is already remotely connectible a virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu. So a bind using monotone can be performed using the command: 


   _mtn --db=server.mtn --bind=virtual2.cbi.utsa.edu serve_

A solution must be made so that the separate repositories can all be accessible via the single url.
